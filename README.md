# Photography helps with better education

## 1.slide
Hi my name is Nikola Abrahámová and I am going to tell you about my bachelor's thesis, which is called Photography helps to better education.
Photography has the ability to capture moments that open doors to the past and to the human soul. 
This thesis looks at the most common mistakes parents make that can affect their children later in life.

## 2.slide
I had to research all the important aspects to make the work original and meaningful at the same time. I needed the audience to be intrigued, to stop and think about the importance of the subject.

## 3. slide
Since I wanted to do portraits, I needed to find out as much as I could about them, so I researched portraits from different centuries. How they were photographed, how they differed.

## 4. slide
I didn't want it to be just portraits, but I wanted to do it from start to finish somehow, so I decided to go in the form of campaigns. So I had to figure out how to properly do a campaign from start to finish, what's the point of having a photo in there, how to make the text look engaging and much more.

## 5. slide
I needed to research campaigns, what they look like and how professionals do them. I found a very interesting campaign called population by pixels. Another one is on domestic violence and campaigns related to children.

## 6. slide
It was also necessary to find photographers. Since I was interested in social content I chose 3 photographers that fit my theme. Their names are Sally Mann, Lewis Hine, Mary Ellen Mark.

## 7.slide
In my work I have drawn on a body of knowledge, books and interviews with psychologists and experts in family relationships. These experts provided me with deeper insight into the issue  of parenting and helped me to better understand the complexities of family relationships.

## 8.slide
I had a lot of questions for the experts and we discussed the most common mistakes parents make and how they affect children. We discussed how it affects them, how they behave as children and then as adults. We debated whether or not something can be influenced later in life.

It took a lot of time to come to a conclusion and compile the most important points.
But you can see the most important ones in the presentation.

## 9.slide
I would like to start by saying that photography is a powerful tool in drawing attention to an issue, and that's why I chose it that way. This is a serious subject, but it is not being highlighted in any way.

## 10. slide
Here you can see the campaign I created. In the practical part of my bachelor's (bačelr)  thesis I decided to use black and white photos with a red stripe. The choice of red was carefully thought out and based on several reasons. 
One key reason is the strength of emotion associated with the colour red. I wanted to ensure (enšour) that the important elements of the text or stripe in the images would attract attention. The color red is known for its ability to evoke strong emotional reactions and capture the attention of viewers.
Another factor is the contrast and visual impact that red offers in contrast to black and white images. This contrast helps to create interesting and aesthetic compositions.

These are portraits of victims of parenthood.

## 12. slide
I would like to share with you a visual concept of how I imagine presenting my work. The attached small white squares next to the photographs contain real stories from people who experienced suffering in childhood.

## 13.slide
I would like to let you read the life stories of the people I have interacted with. I hope that by reading these stories people will be motivated to think. To read them, you need complete peace of mind so that you can empathize with their situation.

Stories

## 19.slide
I have connected with people who have gone through difficult trials in life since they were children. Despite all the challenges they faced, they decided to create a happy and healthy family. Their courage and love are a true inspiration to me.
Despite all the personal difficulties, they have managed to become model parents. Their home is full of love, joy and security for their children. I had the privilege to be part of their story and capture their children's rooms through photographs.

## 20. slide
These photos are not just ordinary snapshots, but a testament to the strength and determination of parents who have learned from their experiences and decided to create a better environment for their children. These are rooms full of hope where a miracle happens every day - the miracle  of parental love, care and security.

This is the end of the video, Thank you so much for sticking with it to the end.
